# Iris-Flower-Classification
This repository contains an internship task focused on Iris flower classification using machine learning. The task involves training a model to classify the three Iris species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica - based on their measurements. The dataset used is from Scikit-learn.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this classification task can be downloaded either from Scikit-learn’s built-in dataset or from an external source. It contains 150 samples, with 50 samples from each species. Each sample is described by four features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
These features are used as input to classify the flower species into one of three categories: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

# Task Overview
- Objective: Train a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into one of the three species based on their features.
- Approach: Implement various classification algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.) to determine the most accurate model for this task.
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for data visualization).

# Steps Involved
1. Load the Dataset: Import the Iris flower dataset using Scikit-learn or download it from an external source.
2. Preprocess the Data: Check for missing values, normalize or scale the data if necessary.
3. Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Model: Train different classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, KNN).
5. Evaluate the Model: Use performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.
6. Visualize Results: Visualize the data and results using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the code interactively)
